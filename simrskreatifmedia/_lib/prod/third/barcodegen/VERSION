v2.2.0		13 feb	2010		Added the support for GS1-128 (EAN-128).
					Fix ISBN text support to be the right font.
					Make sure the /html files are formatted.
v2.1.0		8  nov	2009		Added a way to change the DPI before saving (BCGDrawing::setDPI()). Set the value to null if you want to improve the performance and still have 72dpi.
					But you can set it to 300 if you wish to print it. 
					You do not need an additional DLL for this.
					Added a way to rotate in degree the barcode before saving (BCGDrawing::setRotationAngle()).
					Added a verification if you have GD installed... So that way you know it before contacting support :)
					Fix HTML display for Code 93 and Code 39 Extended buttons
					You can now specify a specific table for Code 128. For instance, if you want to force to use the table B, you would write the following to parse
					array(CODE128_B, 'The Text To Encode')
					The default table selection for Code 128 is automatically chosen.
					Fix many PHP4 errors.
